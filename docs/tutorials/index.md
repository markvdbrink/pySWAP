# Creating SWAP models

There are three ways to get started with SWAP models in pySWAP. The following notebooks present these ways:

1. [Basic usage](docs/tutorials/notebooks/001-basic-usage.ipynb) - create a simple model by defining classes which are part of a final Model instance.
2. [HDF5 database]() - save to and load models from an HDF5 database
3. [Load classic swp file]() - convert a classic swap model setup into pySWAP classes
