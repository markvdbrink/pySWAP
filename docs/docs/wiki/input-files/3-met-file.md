# .MET

Originally, the meteorological data was passed to SWAP in files that had extensions equal to the last three digits of the year. However, the option to use one file (csv-like) with .met extension seems to be the best choice for simplicity. Therefore, for now, pySWAP only allows to use the .met file.

Depending on the selected option, the .met file will have a different set of headers.
