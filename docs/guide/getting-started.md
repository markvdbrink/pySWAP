# Getting started

## Installation

Currently the package is only distributed as a repository on GitHub. Follow the recommended workflow to get it up and running on your machine:

```Shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/zawadzkim/pySWAP.git
```

::: info :information_source:
Please note that it is necessary to use `--recurse-submodule` flag to make sure that additional submodules in the library are also cloned along with pySWAP.
:::

Once you are in the freshly cloned repo, type:

```Shell
pip install .
```

You can also install it in development mode in case you would like to make changes (and hopefully submit PRs):

```Shell
pip install -e .
```

## Run a test case

To see if everything is working fine, open the Python shell and type:

```Python shell
>>> from pyswap import testcase

>>> hupsel = testcase.get('hupsel')  # retrieves the hupsel model settings
>>> result = hupsel.run()
>>> print(result.summary)
```

You should get back the formatted string with water balance summary (here given just for one year):

```txt
* Project:       pySWAP test - hupsel brook
* File content:  detailed overview of water balance components (cm)
* File name:     ./result.blc
* Model version: Swap 4.2.0
